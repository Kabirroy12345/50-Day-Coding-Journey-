ðŸš€ Starting Strong: Day 1 of the 50-Day Coding Journey! ðŸ’»
 (Yes, Iâ€™m 3 days lateâ€¦ but hey, itâ€™s never too late to start something meaningful! ðŸ’ª)
As part of the hashtag#DrGViswanathan initiative by VIT Bhopal in collaboration with FACE Prep, Iâ€™m officially starting my 50 Days Coding Challenge today!
Special thanks to Shriram R Sir for the initiative.
This journey is all about staying consistent, sharpening problem-solving skills, and preparing for both product and service-based placements. Whether itâ€™s brushing up on fundamentals or diving into core DSA topicsâ€”each day is a step forward. Letâ€™s make it count.
ðŸ”¹ Day 1 Challenges:
ðŸ§© Challenge 1 - Data Structures (Linked List):
 ðŸ”— Reverse Linked List
ðŸ§® Challenge 2 - Programming Fundamentals (Math based):
 ðŸ”— Missing Number
Learning never stopsâ€”and progress doesnâ€™t care when you start, only that you do. Onward and upward! ðŸš€
